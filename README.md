# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎄

Welcome to my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024), an annual programming challenge that takes place during December! This repository contains my implementations for each day's puzzle, written in Python.

## 🌟 What is Advent of Code?
Advent of Code (AoC) is a series of programming puzzles created by Eric Wastl. It’s a great way to practice problem-solving and coding skills with daily challenges that become progressively more difficult throughout the month.

## 📂 Repository Structure
This repository is organized by days, with each folder containing the solution and any supporting files:

```
advent-of-code-2024/
│
├── day01/
│   ├── input.txt         # Puzzle input
│   ├── solution.py       # Solution script
│   └── README.md         # Explanation of the solution
│
├── day02/
│   ├── input.txt
│   ├── solution.py
│   └── README.md
│
└── ...
```

- Each folder corresponds to a specific day.
- The `input.txt` file contains the puzzle input for that day.
- The `solution.py` file contains the implementation of the solution.

## 🚀 How to Run
To execute the solutions for a specific day:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ctejada10/advent-of-code-2024.git
   cd advent-of-code-2024
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired day:
   ```bash
   cd day01
   ```

3. Run the solution:
   ```bash
   python solution.py
   ```

4. (Optional) Provide a custom input file:
   ```bash
   python solution.py <path-to-custom-input>
   ```

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
This repository leverages:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) for implementations
- Any additional tools (e.g., `numpy`, `pytest`, etc.)

## 📝 Contributing
Feel free to submit a pull request if you'd like to share improvements, alternate solutions, or ideas for better performance.

## 🏆 My Goals for AoC 2024
1. Complete all 25 days.
2. Write clean, efficient, and well-documented code.
3. Explore alternative solutions where possible.
